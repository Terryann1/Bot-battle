## Core Deliverables
- See profiles of all bots rendered in 'BotCollection'
- Add an individual bot to my army by clicking on it. The selected bot should render in the "YourBotArmy' component. The bot can be enlisted only **once**. The bot **does not** disappear from the 'BotCollection'.
- Release a bot from my army by clicking on it. The bot disappears from the 'YourBotArmy' component
- Discharge a bot from their service forever, by clicking the red button marked "x", which would delete the bot both from the backend and from the 'YourBotArmy' on the frontend.
